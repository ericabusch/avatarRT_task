# avatarRT_task

This repository contains 1) the Unity 3D project for the video game task which was used in our real-time fMRI experiment and 2) the python scripts / environment used to drive the experiment. Note that the python scripts reference the rt-cloud project environment; to run the experiment with rt-cloud, the python script `avatarRT.py`, `avatarRT_presentation.py`, `configure_config.py`, `run_subject_service.py` will need to be placed inside of a rt-cloud project directory such as [here](https://github.com/ericabusch/rt-cloud) (see the avatarRT directory).

To run the Unity experiment, you will need to change the path to the parameters file (`experimenter_computer/experiment/params.txt`) to match your computer's local filepath -- both in line 3 of the params.txt file and in the Unity script found at `Assets/Scripts/InfoLoader.cs`. When you hit the play button in the Unity app (Unity version 2019.4.12f1), the game will automatically begin reading in files from the path `experimenter_computer/experiment/subjects/$PARTICIPANT_ID/$SESSION_ID/$RUN_ID/scanner_comms`. These will be read in immediately, but if you wish to generate them at the speed of the fMRI scanner, you can run `simulate_scanner_output.py` and change the output path in that script to your `experimenter_computer/experiment/subjects/$PARTICIPANT_ID/$SESSION_ID/$RUN_ID/scanner_comms`.
